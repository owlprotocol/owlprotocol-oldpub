# Introduction

Owl Protocol is creating a set of *open source* smart contracts, standards, and APIs for creators and developers to easily:

1. Create Dynamic NFTs, such as those that change over time, or in response to certain **decentralized oracles** or triggers.

2. Deploy **"recipes"** or **"interactions"** between different NFTs, to enable complex mechanics such as crafting, combining, breeding and more.

<br/>
<br/>

Our aim is to improve the interoperability and composability of NFTs through these standards so that NFTs can be truly
decentralized and exist in many worlds, virtual or real.

Our smart contracts add a number of features in a **modular** fashion to maximize the *backwards compatibility* and
flexibility of what we call **Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs)**.

This makes common NFT mechanics such as *combining, bundling, crafting, breeding and more*, easier for developers and
creators, so they can focus on what they do best: **making great games, projects, and partnerships happen**.

## Smart Contracts / Github

You can find the source code for our **Dynamic NFT Smart Contracts** on Github at: https://github.com/owlprotocol/contracts.

## APIs and SDKs

- *Owl Protocol is launching a SDK for easier integration with its Dynamic NFT Smart Contracts in Q1 2023.*

---

## No-Code Interface

Owl Protocol also has a no-code interface that is tailored to allow non-technical creators, businesses, and NFT project owners to easily deploy, configure, and manage Dynamic NFTs.

### For the Creator:

- Allows the NFT creator to create many different mechanics for their NFTs, as well as create crafting recipes that involve NFT other collections they **DO NOT** own.
- View their NFT collections, and where possible modify the parameters and view statistics on the collection's NFTs.

### For the User:

- Users can explore and interact with the **Dynamic NFT** mechanics enabled by Owl Protocol.
- Users can **discover new promotions and utilities**, that their NFT gives them access to, which can be created by any 3rd-party external projects.

## Why Use Owl Protocol?

### Modular and Backwards Compatible

Many other Dynamic NFT projects create over-complicated custom smart contracts for one-off use-cases, or worse they use a **centralized/traditional** API endpoint they have full control over.

At Owl Protocol we are building smart contracts that are backwards compatible with existing marketplaces, and moving complex logic to modular smart contracts or proxies.
That way you can build on top of your existing collection, or extend off of other collections.

### Open Source Smart Contracts

Owl Protocol's smart contracts will always be open-source. Our goal is to improve accessibility to Dynamic NFT features that have for a long time been reserved
only for well-funded projects.

We believe that the current lack of access to advanced dynamic mechanics restricts the creativity of artists, creators, and developers.

Therefore, we will continue to listen to feedback and develop new features where we see a common demand.

## Deploy It Yourself

Owl Protocol's smart contracts make use of a number of EIP standards to achieve standardization, convenience, and leading edge compatibility across different chains.
It also helps when deploying on many networks at once, and **maintains the same deterministic address on all chains**.

Therefore, deploying the smart contracts yourself is a bit harder, but if you're interested
we have some scripts to make it slightly easier to manage the proxies and contracts.
