# Reference

## Crafter contracts

Crafter contracts implement input(s) -> output(s) crafting mechanism for ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens. Supports both transfer of existing tokens as well as the minting of new ones (in this case, configured for OWL tokens).

Two implementations are available for Crafter:
- `CrafterMint`: mints output tokens during a craft.
- `CrafterTransfer`: transfers output tokens from a deposit.
