# useGetAssets

Fetch all tokenized assets for address.
This is achieved by getting all ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 `Transfer` events associated with an `address` to get a theoretical subset of all assets that `address` potentially owns. Not guaranteed to work with non-interface compliant assets but offers an alternative to off-chain indexing.
